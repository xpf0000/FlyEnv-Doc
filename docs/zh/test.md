### Highlights
- **Swift Multi-Version Switching**:
  Seamlessly switch between multiple versions of PHP, NodeJS, Java, and more. For example, run PHP 5.6 and PHP 8.3 side by side, or switch between JDK 8 and JDK 20 in seconds.

- **Full-Stack Environment Integration**:
  From web servers (Nginx/Apache) to databases (MySQL/Redis) and message queues, FlyEnv provides a one-command setup for your entire tech stack.

- **Project-Level Environment Isolation**:
  FlyEnv enables per-project runtime version management for NodeJS/PHP/Python and more. The environment automatically switches when entering the project directory via Terminal or PowerShell — **no manual setup required**.

- **Native Performance**:
  FlyEnv runs as native static binaries, eliminating the overhead of virtual containers. This means faster startup times, lower memory usage, and a smoother development experience.

- **Cross-Platform Consistency**:
  Whether you're on macOS, Windows, or Linux, FlyEnv ensures a consistent development environment across all platforms. Say goodbye to "it works on my machine" issues.

- **Resource Efficiency**:
  FlyEnv is lightweight and optimized for performance. Running Nginx, PHP, MySQL, and Redis together consumes less than one-third of the resources compared to traditional Docker setups.

- **Developer-Friendly Tools**:
    - **Config & Log Management**: Aggregate all configuration files with a single command and access them directly in VSCode or Vim. Real-time log streaming with error highlighting makes debugging a breeze.
    - **Local Web Hosting**: Create local sites with custom domain names and HTTPS support.
    - **One-Click SSL Certificates**: Generate self-signed SSL certificates with a single click.

- **Production-Ready Environments**:
  FlyEnv's configurations are designed to mirror real-world production environments, making it easy to transition from development to deployment.
