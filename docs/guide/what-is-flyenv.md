# What is FlyEnv?

FlyEnv is an all-in-one full-stack environment management tool. Help developers quickly set up a local development environment.

It simplifies development by offering **swift multi-version switching**, **full-stack technology support**, and a **seamless cross-platform experience**. Whether you're working with PHP, NodeJS, Java, Go, or Python, FlyEnv integrates all necessary tools with a single command, eliminating configuration headaches and letting you focus on what truly matters—**creation, not debugging**.

In short, FlyEnv provides a complete operating environment, helping users develop and debug applications like Laravel, WordPress, Yii2, FastAdmin, NestJS, SpringBoot, Gin, Beego, Django, Flask, and more.

1. **JSON Parsing**: Convert between JSON, JavaScript objects, PHP arrays, XML, YAML, and more.
2. **Port & Process Management**: Kill processes by port number or command.
3. **Project Templates**: Quickly create projects for Laravel, WordPress, Yii2, Next.js, Vue, NestJS, and more.


## Why Choose FlyEnv?

### Compared to Docker
Docker is powerful, but many developers just want a ready-to-use environment for PHP, NodeJS, Java, Go, or Python. FlyEnv is **more intuitive and lightweight**:
- No virtual containers—all modules run as native static binaries.
- Faster performance and lower resource usage (especially on macOS and Windows).
- Easier to view and modify configuration and log files.

### Compared to MAMP Pro, Laravel Herd, XAMPP, etc.
FlyEnv is **more flexible and up-to-date**:
- Supports multiple installation sources (Homebrew, Macports, APT, DNF, official binaries, etc.).
- Timely version updates—no need to wait for FlyEnv upgrades.
- Configuration files and settings are closer to real production environments, making deployment easier.

## Customization and Optimization
- **Hide Unused Modules**: FlyEnv allows you to hide unnecessary modules in the settings, reducing clutter.
- **Network Issues**: If installation is slow due to network limitations, you can install software manually and add custom paths to FlyEnv.
- **Configuration Optimization**: FlyEnv uses general configurations by default. If specific modules or extensions are needed for your project, submit a GitHub Issue or leave feedback for optimization.

## Community-Driven Improvement
FlyEnv is designed to grow with the help of its community. Many features are built to cover basic functionality, and feedback from advanced users is highly valued. Together, we can:
- Add support for more software.
- Improve tools and performance.
- Make development easier, so you can spend more time with your family and achieve your goals.
