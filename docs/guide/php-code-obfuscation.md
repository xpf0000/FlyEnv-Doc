# PHP Code Obfuscation

PHP code obfuscation refers to the conversion of PHP code into an unintelligible form to protect the security and confidentiality of the code. The following are common PHP code obfuscation techniques:

1. Compressing code: Compressing code into a single line by removing spaces, line breaks, comments, etc. to make it difficult to understand.

2. Variable substitution: replace variable names with random strings to make it hard to be recognized and deciphered.

3. Function name substitution: Replace function names with random strings to make them difficult to identify and decipher.

4. Encrypt string: encrypt the string and decrypt it at runtime to protect the string from being compromised.

5. Control flow obfuscation: making code difficult to understand and decipher by changing the order in which it is run, adding useless code, etc.

It should be noted that although PHP code obfuscation can increase the security and confidentiality of the code, it will also increase the difficulty of maintaining the code and reduce the operation efficiency.

Therefore, you should choose and use it according to your actual needs and situation. Also, care should be taken to choose a reliable PHP code obfuscation tool to avoid unpredictable problems.

In addition, it should be noted that PHP code obfuscation does not completely protect the code from being cracked, but only increases the difficulty of cracking.

Therefore, it is also necessary to combine other security measures, such as permission control, input validation, encrypted transmission, etc., to improve the security and confidentiality of the code.

Here are some common PHP code obfuscation tools:

1. Zend Guard: Zend Guard is a commercial PHP code obfuscation tool that compiles PHP code into binary files, providing a variety of protection and obfuscation options.

2. IonCube: IonCube is a commercial PHP code obfuscation tool that compiles PHP code into binary files, providing a variety of protection and obfuscation options.

3. PHP Obfuscator: PHP Obfuscator is a free online PHP code obfuscation tool that obfuscates PHP code by compressing, replacing variable names, function names, etc.

4. SourceGuardian: SourceGuardian is a commercial PHP code obfuscation tool that compiles PHP code into binary files, providing a variety of protection and obfuscation options.

5. PHP Protect: PHP Protect is a commercial PHP code obfuscation tool that obfuscates PHP code by compressing and replacing variable names and function names, and also provides features such as encrypted strings and control flow obfuscation.

6. PHPPacker: PHPPacker is a free online PHP code obfuscation tool that compresses PHP code into a single line and performs variable name and function name substitution for obfuscation.

FlyEnv integrates PHP code obfuscation to help developers obfuscate PHP code into a form that is difficult to be cracked, thus increasing the security and confidentiality of the code.

Our code obfuscation feature can obfuscate PHP code by compressing, replacing variable names, function names, etc., and provides various protection options such as encrypted strings, control flow obfuscation, etc.

These obfuscation techniques can effectively prevent the code from being cracked and stolen, and improve the security and confidentiality of the code.

To use the PHP code obfuscation tool, click Tools->Php Obfuscator, enter the PHP code obfuscation tool

Select a single php file or project folder, you can obfuscate a single php file or the whole project

The PHP code like this:

```php
<?php
class Test {
    private $a = 0;
    protected $b = 1;
    public $c = 2;

    public function add() {
        return $this->b + $this->a + $this->c;
    }
}

class Text {
    private $str = '';

    public function __construct($str){
        $this->str = $str;
    }

    public function toString() {
        return " The Text is: {$this->str}";
    }
}

$test = new Test();
$value = $test->add();
echo $value;

$text = new Text('PHP Code Obfuscation Test');
$value = $text->toString();
echo $value;
```

will be obfuscated into the following code

```php
<?php
 goto LtBfp; owOLm: $cRfp0 = $y7zSz->nztUz(); goto IKtKr; tIX85: class R1Y9H { private $I8L4A = ''; public function __construct($wTiwF) { $this->I8L4A = $wTiwF; } public function NzTUz() { return "\x20\x54\150\145\40\x54\145\170\164\x20\x69\163\x3a\40{$this->I8L4A}"; } } goto BW458; hxUVm: echo $cRfp0; goto xMa32; LtBfp: class nNmnL { private $MGe1P = 0; protected $Uvmg9 = 1; public $byk5B = 2; public function add() { return $this->Uvmg9 + $this->MGe1P + $this->byk5B; } } goto tIX85; BW458: $rkfS7 = new NNMnL(); goto rgLTA; rgLTA: $cRfp0 = $rkfS7->add(); goto hxUVm; xMa32: $y7zSz = new r1Y9H("\120\110\x50\x20\103\x6f\144\145\x20\x4f\x62\146\x75\x73\143\x61\164\x69\157\x6e\40\124\145\x73\164"); goto owOLm; IKtKr: echo $cRfp0;
```
