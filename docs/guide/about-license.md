# 📜 FlyEnv Licensing Guide

The FlyEnv licensing model is designed to sustain the project’s growth while honoring the creator's dedication. Our goal is **not to impose restrictions**, but to foster a culture of respect for independent development and intellectual property.

Activating a license is a way to acknowledge the work behind FlyEnv. By doing so, you support the project's longevity and contribute to a spirit of mutual trust within the global developer community.

## 1. Evaluation Version Limitations

FlyEnv remains functional without a license, but the following limits apply to the evaluation version:

* **Site Management**: Limited to a maximum of **3** local sites.
* **AI Assistant**: Access to AI-powered features is restricted to a **3-day** trial.
* **Screenshot Utility**: The built-in screenshot tool is limited to a **3-day** trial.
* **Image Optimizer**: The image compression utility is limited to a **3-day** trial.
* **Future Updates**: New premium features may be subject to similar trial periods or limits.

**Core runtimes and environment management features will always remain accessible.** The license is less about "unlocking software" and more about **investing in the tool's future.** We believe developer tools should be accessible, so we avoid rigid paywalls. Whether you contribute through a donation, code, or by spreading the word, you are helping us build a faster, leaner development ecosystem.
