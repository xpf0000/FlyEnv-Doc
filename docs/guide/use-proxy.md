Most VPNs do not automatically take effect in the terminal or FlyEnv. If you want VPN to work in FlyEnv, you need to do the following operations:

1. Some VPN tool like ClashX, has the function of 'Copy terminal proxy command'. You can just use the function. Copy proxy command. And paste it in FlyEnv->setup->Proxy Setting

2. All VPN has a proxy port. Click FlyEnv->setup->Proxy Setting->Quick Setup. And input ip:port like 127.0.0.1:7890. Then click OK. It's will auto generate proxy commands
